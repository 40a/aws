"aws" is a command line program that accesses Amazon Web Services.

My fork contains patches and YAML support (aws --yaml [--ruby] foobar).
There are some branches:
  mixed-format:
    my working branch (active)
  master:
    as same as mixed-format,
    but the code are formatted by 'perltidy'
  test_yaml:
    private work to test YAML support
