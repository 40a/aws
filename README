"aws" is a command line program that accesses Amazon Web Services:

EC2
S3
SQS
SDB -- Just added!!
ELB

To run "aws", all you need is a single file! Download it http://github.com/timkay/aws/blob/master/aws, make it executable, create ~/.awssecrets, and you are done.

For more documentation, see http://timkay.com/aws/

If you can help improve the "aws" documentation, please let me know.
